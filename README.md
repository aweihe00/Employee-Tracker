Employee Management System

**Brooklyn Nine-Nine's** Own Employee Management System that allows users to view and update employees, roles, and departments.

Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.
